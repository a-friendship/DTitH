        <h2>My Brilliant Friend</h2>
        <p><i>My Brilliant Friend</i> came out in 2011 and nobody expected the success that would come from such a book.</p>
        <p>The novel – <i>which has since then turned into a quartet</i> – has been by now translated in many languages and even became <b>a well-known TV series</b> that made the book saga even more beloved by its readers.</p>
<p>On top of this, the mystery behind the author of the books has raised many questions and concerns when it comes to authorship, for example it has been investigated whether it is impossible to determine an author's sex through <i>text analysis tools</i>.
  <p>This new approach to publishing has also raised the question about how truly important it is <b>to know an author's true identity</b> and how this ends up affecting their own books</p>
<p>What we can say for now is that Elena Ferrante has created an empire and a whole new literature, through her style – the infamous <i>scapigliatura</i> – and her attentive and ruthless knowledge of feminine souls.</p>
<p>Still, if this is the first time that you have heard of this novel, what you must know - before consulting this digital edition - is that this series is <b>set in Naples, during the 1950s</b>, although the books cover a whole temporal space of whole decaeds, till nowadays.</p>
        <p>the story is centered on <b>two girls</b> – Lila and Lenù – childhood friends and life-long rivals.</p>
<p>It’s a tale of deep-rooted friendship, hate and rivalry that will bring the reader to question each word said by the narrator – none other than <i>Lenù, herself</i> – and at the same time to hope for a happy ending for these two and their own families.</p>
        <p>Discover Lila's and Lenu's lives through reading this digital edition, which has made available to the reader a few tools to actually further understand the text:
        <ul>
            <li> The possibility to highlight in the various branches of texts the characters and the events happening during those chapters</i>
        <li>A list of all the characters contained in the text chosen.</li>

            <h3> The Author</h3>
            <p><div class="aldina">Euripides was born in Salamina in 485 BC and died in 406 BC in Pellas, although it is plausible that he never visited Macedonia</p>
            <p>In fact, many accounts of his life appear either fables or comic, to the point that many of the sources for his biographies are often his enemies, for example, Aristophanes, who had him as a character in three of his plays </p>
            <p>Euripides was quite the contrasting figure when it came to opinions on his plays.</p>
            <p>His first victory in the Dionysia, the main religious festivities of Greece, didn't come till 441 BC and his last was awarded posthumously.</p>
            <p>In total he won five times, which was quite the low number if compared to Sophocles' eighteen times and Aeschylus' thirteen times </p>
            <p>His production didn't in fact sit well with many of his contemporaries and is nothing else than a symptom of the historical passage they were living in, with a change of generations that made Euripides' continous evolution through his plays all more interesting to follow through. </p>
            <p>Sadly this evolution isn't easy to follow through due to the fragmentary nature of Euripides' production, but other than his importance for bringing up new themes and a renown study of the human psyche, this author also invented a few elements that are still used in the modern theatre, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the employment of further technical devices to further make the play spectacular</li>
                <li>the use of rhethorical techniques to convey the knowledge that there isn't an universal truth</li>
                <li>the <q>deus ex machina</q>, which was employed by others before Euripides, but with this author became an established stage machine.<br>This device was used to further convey an emotional involvement of the audience, alongside to present on stage the figure of a god, to enhance amazement</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Play</h3>
            <p><div class="aldina">M<i>edea</i> is actually one of the first plays written by Euripides</p>
            <p>It was produced in 431 BC and it earned Euripides the third prize at the City Dionisya, a terrible reception although the competition of that year was quite good, having Sophocles - a fan favorite - coming only at the second place.</p>
            <p>The story revolves around the Colchian princess Medea who arrived alongside her husband, Jason, in the Greek world</p>
            <p>Here she isn't only marginalized as a foreigner, but her husband also chooses to remarry a Corinthian princess to befriend her father, Creon, head of the city</p>
            <p>All of this brings Medea to come up with a few different ideas to make her husband pay for his deeds and disrespect, involving in her plot not only his future bride but also the sons she had with Jason</p>
            <p><q>Medea</q> is the sole Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer ends up unpunished and triumphant, since at the end of the play it's Medea who triumphs, having lost everything she had</p>
            <p>The main themes of this play are passion, love and vegeance, although different views have been given through the centuries, such as of Medea as a <q>proto-feminist</q>, fighting against the patriarchal society or as a foreign and irrational presence in an otherwise rational world </p>
            <p>We hope you'll enjoy our choice in texts, which we thought better represent Medea's journey as a <q>lover</q> through the play.</p>  
        </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="textsection" id="MedeaApp">
            <h3>The Author</h3>
            <p><div class="aldina">Apollonius Rhodius is quite the mysterious author, since many sources differ about different aspect of his life and we could pinpoint his existence very very largely to the 3rd century BC</p>
            <p>There still a few facts that are common among the sources, although many other details still diverge, such as his relationship of competition with Callimachus and the fact that for a certain amount of time he was the head of the library of Alexandria</p>
            <p>Even his name seems still quite debated, mostly because although a few sources associate it to his move from Alexandria to Rhodes, at the end of his term as of the head of the Library of Alexandria, others instead insist that he actually came from Rhodes and moved to Alexandria.</p>
            <p>Some other theories just say that, the epithet was just used to distance him from another Apollonius, and the choice of <q>Rhodius</q> was due to the fact that he wrote a poem about Rhodes</p>
            <p>In all of this theorizing, many believes that his <q>Argonautica</q>, his finest work, was in fact created at Rhodes, in order to make the author famous and to make him chase away the hated Callimachus, who many rumored had written the <q>Ibis</q> poem against.</p>
            <p>Still only recently Apollonius Rhodius have been able to reap the fruit of his hard work, since only recently his work had been truly recognized and appreciated</p>
            <h3>The Book</h3>
            <p><div class="aldina">Instead of dealing with Medea, <i>Argonautica</i> deals with the lives of the infamous argonauts and their travel to reach the infamous Golden Fleece, which was rumored to be magic</q>
            <p>At the head of the argonauts we have Jason, and in the third book of this work, we also find Medea, a very different Medea from the one we have met in Euripides</p>
            <p>In this case, Medea has just come to the realization of her feelings for Jason, which creates a terrible contrast with her loyalty to her family, against whom her lover is fighting</p>
            <p>The passage we chose in this case is meant to highlight this aspect, as we see Medea talking with her sister about her feelings and then with herself, foreseeing the shame that would follow her choosing Jason</p>
            <p> Still, in the end Medea chooses to risk it all, and aid Jason through the various trials her father has decided to put the hero through</p>
            <p>The <i>Argonautica</i> has been undoubtedly influenced by two main sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The old epic poems such as the <q>Iliad</q> and <q>Odissey</q> for its content</li>
                <li>The stylistic theme of the time for the frame</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This way Apollonius has recreated a new brand of epic, which has then influenced authors, first of which Virgil for the creation of the female figures in his own poem, across all centuries, in its reimagining of Jason's travels</p>
