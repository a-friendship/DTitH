    <h2>Documentation of the Project</h2>
    <div id="projintro">
      <h3>1. Project introduction</h3>
        <p><i>My Brilliant Friend</i> was first published in 2011, and it immediately proved to be one of the most interesting novels of the latest years, with various translations across the world and a mystery behind its anonymous author, Elena Ferrante.</p>
        <p>Still, it is the <b>friendship</b> between the two main characters – Lila and Lenù – that had oftentimes fascinated readers and viewers of the TV series across the whole world:</p>
<p><blockquote>“Too often we focus our discussions on romance, however, friendship is maybe the most underestimated of all human connections, and female friendship probably the most difficult one” <a href="">(Lazy Women, 2021)</a>.</blockquote></p>
        <p>It’s difficult to find a <b>positive and accurate representation of female friendships</b> in the most recent medias, since it either borders on a positive and superficial view or it pushes girls to be competitors for the attention of the other sex. Still, Elena Ferrante creates a complex relationship and unlikeable characters: it seems almost impossible for Lila and Lenù to be <b>each other’s best friend and most terrible rival, at the same time</b>, but it is the closest description we can give to their situation, since both the characters hold <b>bad feelings</b> and <b>resentment</b> for the other, creating a deeper layer to the relationships between them:
<blockquote>“We tend to project in our friends what we would like to be but if we don’t succeed like them, we start feeling frustrated and competitive” <a href="">(Lazy Women, 2021)</a>.</blockquote>
        <p>So, when Lila isn’t allowed to finish school, she becomes disinterested in Lenù, while, for example, Lenù feels jealousy at her friend’s picture-perfect wedding. But this obviously doesn’t mean the one between the two friends is a façade, since it is quite obvious that they don’t only hate the other, but instead they rely on each other, almost fully, as they do with nobody else:</p>
<blockquote>“Though Lila and Lenù often fail to communicate the ways in which they look to each other for guidance or admit how profoundly they depend on each other, they nonetheless circle each other, emulate each other, and compete with each other as their friendship proves itself to be the driving force behind the major decisions of their lives” <a href="">(Litcharts, n.d.)</a>.</blockquote>
        <p>They might be constantly <b>envious of each other’s success</b>, but they also are <b>the first one to support the other</b>, when needed: it is Lila who gives Lenù the money to buy her scholastic books when she can’t, and it is also her who helps her study when the other girl struggles with the new subjects, upon starting middlegrade, while Lenù returns the favor helping Lila when she feels at her worst and keeping the secret of her relationship between her friend and Nino.</p>
<p>The friendship between Lila and Lenù is an intricate and complex thing, bordering on words such as obsession <b>obsession</b> and <b>hate</b>: 
<blockquote>“Their rivalry magnetizes them: each is the one the other trusts, and so fears” <a href="">(Reel Honey, 2019)</a>.</blockquote>
        <p>Both characters are <b>constantly wary of each other</b> because they represent to them, <b>what they could never be</b>. Each of the girls is embedded in the other’s body and mind, impossible to know anything but each other, even as they part, change cities and the years pass.</p>
<p>It is a proof this the fact that when Lenù starts recounting the past at the start of the novel, she doesn’t do it for any other reason than the hope to have Lila, who has disappeared from the world, haunt her through memory and physically, since the girl had always been against the idea of her friend writing about her.</p>

      <h3>2. Methodologies</h3>
                 <p>The complexity of such a relationship brought me to try to analyze <b>the sources</b> of it, through some <b>digital tools and environments</b>, combining <b>a quantitative approach</b> to a <b>qualitative one</b>. For this reason, I started working on this project, selecting the first part (<i>Infanzia: Storia di Don Achille</i>) of the first novel (<i>My Brilliant Friend</i>) where the bond between Lila and Lenù is first formed. The possibility of working through a quotative methodology allowed to actually create a cooperative environment, creating a collective system <a href="">(Moretti, 2005, 4-5)</a>.
                 <p>To do so, I employed a <i>from the bottom</i> approach, which entailed that I first chose the documents I was interested in (in this case as said above the first part of the first novel), observe their behavior and then derive a schema empirically, or in my case some conclusions regarding the friendship between the two characters; I also didn’t start this work without my own <i>imaginative narratives</i> <a href="">(Flanders-Jannidis, 2019, 17-18)</a>, which I then turned into questions to help me, refine and structure my research:</p>
                 <blockquote>How is Lila’s and Lenù’s relationship portrayed in the novel?</blockquote>
                 <blockquote>What are the main events that bring to such a thing happening?</blockquote>
                 <blockquote>What are the characters that influence such a relationship?</blockquote>
For this I first started my work of ‘editorialization’ through the creation of a digital edition, although it was just a starting point to further develop the digital environment that would be used for this project:
“Bachimont employs editorialization to explain an important shift: that of a non-digital document to a digital document. This shift consists of a transfer of information, which is restructured to be adapted to a digital environment” (Vitali-Rosati, 2018 61-62).
Obviously, the transformation and transportation of the analogue text I chose in the digital reality wasn’t done without the important step of recontextualization and visualization of the results for the reader done through the two different tools (a timeline and a network analysis) to allow them to understand the information contained in the book and represented on their screens.
This brought “A Friendship” to be shaped into a tool that allows the readers the consultation of the text and different types of analysis to visualize on screen the results of the research through the specific tools employed and to further contextualize it.
